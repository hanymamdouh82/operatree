OperaTree is a CLI tool that brings structure, searchability, and intelligence to how you manage projects — using your filesystem and plain YAML as the only storage. No database required. No vendor lock-in. No proprietary formats.

It works the way your OS already works: files and directories. Everything is human-readable, Git-friendly, and pipes naturally into standard UNIX tools.

## Philosophy

Most project management tools store your data in a database you don't control. When the tool dies, your data is trapped. When you switch tools, you lose history.

OperaTree takes the opposite approach:

- **Filesystem is the source of truth** — your project lives in directories you own
- **YAML is the metadata layer** — plain text, readable without any tool
- **The CLI is just an interface** — your data outlives any software

```
your-project/
├── 00_ADMIN/               # governance, contacts, templates
├── 01_EVENTS/              # visits, workshops, meetings
├── 02_PROJECT_MANAGEMENT/  # tasks, reports, risks
├── 03_LEGAL/               # contracts, NDAs, compliance
├── 04_RESEARCH/            # topics, objectives, summaries
├── 05_ENGINEERING/         # architecture, specs, decisions
├── 06_DATA/                # raw → staging → processed pipeline
├── 07_MEDIA_LIBRARY/       # shared reusable assets
├── 08_DELIVERABLES/        # final external outputs
└── 99_ARCHIVE/             # historical storage
```

Each subject (event, task, topic, objective) lives in its own directory with a `META.yaml` file that makes it searchable, filterable, and machine-readable.

---

## Features

- **Bootstrap projects** from opinionated templates in seconds
- **Create subjects** interactively — events, tasks, topics, objectives
- **Fuzzy search** across all metadata fields: names, tags, participants, notes, dates, locations
- **Describe and summarize** projects with colored terminal output
- **Pipe-friendly output** — chain with `grep`, `sed`, `cut`, and other UNIX tools
- **Self-documenting** — `operatree explain` renders the full directory philosophy in your terminal

---

## Installation

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hanymamdouh82/operatree.git
cd operatree
make install
```

### Using go install

```bash
go install github.com/hanymamdouh82/operatree@latest
```

---

## Quick Start

**1. Initialize configuration**

```bash
operatree init
```

Sets up `~/.config/operatree/operatree.yaml` with your standard projects directory.

**2. Bootstrap a new project**

```bash
operatree bootstrap myproject
```

Creates the full directory structure under your configured standard directory.

**3. Create a subject**

```bash
operatree new event
operatree new task
operatree new topic
operatree new objective
```

Launches an interactive form to capture metadata — name, date, tags, participants, notes, and more.

**4. Find anything**

```bash
operatree find                    # browse all subjects interactively
operatree find hany               # fuzzy search across all metadata
operatree find event hany         # filter by type, then fuzzy search
```

**5. Describe and summarize**

```bash
operatree desc                    # full project structure
operatree summary                 # counts, types, status breakdown
operatree explain                 # directory philosophy guide
```

## Commands

Commands are classified to two categories

| Command                        | Description                             |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `operatree init`               | Initialize OperaTree configuration      |
| `operatree bootstrap [name]`   | Bootstrap a new project                 |
| `operatree new [type]`         | Create a new subject interactively      |
| `operatree find [type] [term]` | Fuzzy-find subjects across all metadata |
| `operatree desc`               | Describe project structure              |
| `operatree summary`            | Project summary with counts and status  |
| `operatree explain`            | Print directory philosophy guide        |
| `operatree version`            | Print version                           |

### Global Flags

| Flag         | Default     | Description       |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----------------- |
| `-d, --dest` | from config | Project directory |

## Subject Types

A subject is any trackable unit of work or knowledge within a project.

| Type        | Purpose                                       | Key Fields                         |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `event`     | A project activity — visit, workshop, meeting | date, location, participants, tags |
| `task`      | A unit of work with a lifecycle               | owner, status, related events      |
| `topic`     | A knowledge concept or domain area            | tags, notes, related objective     |
| `objective` | A goal driving research and decisions         | status, findings, strategy         |

All subjects share common fields: `name`, `date`, `tags`, `notes`. Type-specific fields use `omitempty` so they never pollute unrelated subjects.

---

## Search

OperaTree builds a rich search index from all subject metadata — not just names. A single fuzzy query matches against:

- Name
- Tags
- Participants
- Notes
- Date
- Location

```bash
operatree find cairo              # finds events in Cairo, notes mentioning Cairo, etc.
operatree find event emissions    # finds events tagged or named around emissions
```

The interactive finder shows a live preview of each subject as you navigate.

---

## Configuration

Config lives at `~/.config/operatree/operatree.yaml`:

```yaml
standardDir: /home/user/projects
projects:
  - name: myproject
    absPath: /home/user/projects/myproject
    template: dev
daemon:
  enabled: false
  host: localhost
  port: 7070
  dbDriver: sqlite
  dsn: ""
```

Projects are automatically registered when bootstrapped.

## Roadmap

OperaTree is in active development. The foundation is filesystem-first and stable. Future layers will be built on top without breaking it.

| Phase           | Description                                                            | Status     |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| CLI             | Filesystem engine, YAML metadata, fuzzy search, interactive forms      | 🚧 Alpha   |
| Index sidecar   | SQLite mirror for fast queries, no filesystem writes                   | 📋 Planned |
| Daemon          | API over the index, sync engine, configuration-driven engine selection | 📋 Planned |
| Semantic search | Embeddings and vector search over subject metadata                     | 📋 Planned |
| Web platform    | Multi-user, web UI, enterprise features (commercial)                   | 💡 Vision  |
